\lettrine{T}{his} paper introduces a novel approach to Multi-Account and Multi-Tenant Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) in distributed systems and presents a Risk Scores Generation methodology. 
The proposed solution addresses various security challenges inherent in systems utilizing identities and runtime-evaluated policies, particularly in distributed environments, especially when adopting eventual consistency.

By combining Multi-Account and Multi-Tenant PBAC with the Risk Scores Generation approach, the presented solution offers a comprehensive strategy for tackling security concerns. 
It not only enhances the robustness of systems relying on identities and runtime policies but also provides a valuable framework for addressing security issues in distributed systems, particularly those navigating the complexities of eventual consistency.

This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on secure access control mechanisms in distributed systems and lays the foundation for further exploration and refinement of these innovative approaches.
